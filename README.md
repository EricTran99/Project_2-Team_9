Project 2 was defined and started on Monday, Aug 21. In summary, the requirements for the project are:
      Create two DataFrames for the Category and Subcategory data,
      Create DataFrame for the Campaign data,
      Create DataFrame for the Contacts data, and
      Create the crowdfunding_db database


Deliverables

The work was split between the team members.

Four Jupyter Notebook files are developed and delivered. all four files are placed inside the folder "Starter_Files". The files are as follows.
      ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_HGoda : This file contains codes to address the project requirements from the start all the way to exporting DataFrames for Category and Subcategory in two separate .csv files.
      ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_TEric : This file contains codes to address the project requirements to develop the Campaign DataFrame and export it in .csv format.
      ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_JChicas : This file contains codes to address the project requirements to develop the Contacts DataFrame and export it in .csv format.
      Database_code : This file contains codes required to import all four .csv files and assign them to the relevant tables in the SQL database "crowdfunding_db".
  
All .csv files exported are in the "Resources" folder and named category.csv, subcategory.csv, campaign.csv, and contacts.csv

Also in the "Resources" folder, is a file called crowdfunding_db_schema.sql. This file contains the SQL code used to create the database (crowdfunding_db) and its corresponding tables (category subcategory, contacts, and campaign).
